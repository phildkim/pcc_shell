# Commands

This is to get you started with the basic process of writing **bash** commands, organizing your code, running unit tests, and using source control (with **git** and **GitHub**). The task is simple:

1. Create the directory /var/tmp/PCC/CS018/Spring/2019/hello *with a single command*.
2. Print the line in /etc/passwd that corresponds to your username.
3. Show *only* the user id, process id, parent process id, and priority (*in that order*) of the process with PID 1.

Add your solutions into the 1.sh, 2.sh, and 3.sh files (in commands/) respectively. You can run the individual commands with **run.sh** (e.g., **run.sh 2**) to see what they are doing and run the unit tests with **shunit2 test.sh** to check if the commands are correct.
